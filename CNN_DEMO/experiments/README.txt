This folder contains .sh executables which perform hyperparameter grid searches on a 
    validation set.

All results get dumped in the subfolders here.

The next step is to use visualization file in previous folder to compile results and
   determine best hyperparameter combination on average.

Those results can then be used to evaluate on test set etc.
